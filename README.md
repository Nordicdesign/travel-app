# Travel App

This is the final project for the Udacity Nanodegree in front-end development.

The goal is to allow users to enter a destination and date of travel, return the weather forecast and some pictures of the place.

## Scripts

* `npm start`      - starts the backend server
* `npm run dev`    - Front end in development mode
* `npm run build`  - Builds minified for production
* `npm test`       - Runs test suite with JEST and Supertest
